# t1i1Seqgen
Creation of Type 1 Index 1 sequences

To compile the software, `anyoption.cpp` must be present [LINK](https://github.com/hackorama/AnyOption).

To compile on Mac OS X with an Apple Silicon chip, set the terminal app to open in Rosetta (using the Get Info panel), navigate to the directory with these files, and the anyoption.cpp file, and then issue the `make` command.

Once you have compiled the code, you can examine the help options with `./seqgen -h`.
